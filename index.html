    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a tech enthusiast currently trying out frontend development. As a visual learner, I enjoy watching self help videos and podcasts. History and trivia knowledge also spark my interest. I love learning new things and taking up challenges irrespective of niche. Singing,watching movies and engaging in community activities are a form of relaxation and recreation for me. Most of my time is spent online, working and interacting with people. To share knowledge and enjoy conversations on common interests, you can find me on the X app.</p><br>
